This repository houses Arduino code for running on a Water Quality Measurement Device (WQMD). This device and the software to run on it was developed during ENGR302, a Project Management course at Victoria University, for a client representing WaiNZ (Water Action Initiative New Zealand). WaiNZ is a grassroots organisation committed to reducing pollution in NZ waterways through empowering members of the public to be kaitiaki - or guardians - of their waterways.
When deployed to a river or stream, the device samples the temperature and electrical conductivity (the reciprocal of resistance) of the water, storing this data on an onboard micro-SD card.
This data can be wirelessly transferred to a WaiNZ android mobile application, before it is sent on by the phone to the WaiNZ webserver.
